# Aircraft Radar Detection Ranges

## Chart Description/Methodology

A chart showing the detection ranges of all air to air radars in DCS, all values are hand tested with the conditions listed at the top of the chart, I wrote a script to give me a [realtime debug window](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287928410687406080/1035942996622979082/unknown.png) showing me the target aircraft ranges and lookdown angles so I can test them all quickly without having to open the F10 map and use a ruler.

Modules that model Probability of Detection (Mirage 2000C and JF-17) add an extra level of complication, to measure those I have an [array of 10 aircraft flying directly towards me](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287928410687406080/1035943238256836628/unknown.png) while I'm in active pause, as they get closer I wait until I detect 1%, 50% and 100% of jets per sweep and record those ranges. All target aircraft have no payload/stores and fly at an aspect angle of 180 degrees (Directly head to head)

## Changelog/Summary DCS 2.8.6

* Phase 1 of the F/A-18C and F-16C radar reworks is in ðŸŽ‰ Lookdown penalties have been 100% removed for the Hornet and Viper, STT and track mechanics are reworked you can STT sooner that you could before and track files build faster

In the chart test conditions:

### F/A-18C:

* Velocity Search reaches 68nmi

* RWS HPRF increased from 38nmi to 55nmi

* RWS MPRF reduced from 36nmi to 28nmi

### F-16C:

* VSR reaches 41nmi

* RWS reduced from 45nmi to 37nmi

# Aircraft Radar Lookdown Detection Penalties

## Changelog/Summary DCS 2.7.16

There has been a lot of discussion about lookdown penalties recently so I thought I'd test it all and share my results so the discussion goes beyond anecdotal experiences

All ED modules have a massive penalty that will come into effect around 1.5Â° and 2Â° lookdown angle in all PRFs ([Exact formula discovered here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/who13a/dcs_2716_aircraft_radar_lookdown_penalties_chart/ij7du4h/)), as an example with the Hornet as soon as you pass that angle your detection range drops by 33% from 48nmi to 32nmi. Beyond that 2Â° cutoff there is no further penalty, even down to 15-30Â° lookdown. This behaviour has not changed since at least February 2022 (See chart notes for more details)

JF-17 also has a pretty sharp penalty in RWS HPRF past 2.5Â° dropping detection range by ~20% and a minor MPRF penalty that's only noticeable past 7.5Â°, Velocity Scan has no penalties. Most other modules have either 0 or minor penalties that won't be particularly noticeable in real world gameplay.
